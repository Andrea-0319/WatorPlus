# WatorPlus 🐠🦈
## Aim of the project 🎯
The goal of the project is to apply the principles of the design of a system and its implementation studied during the course.

The project consists in building an ecosystem simulation and visualization using the Matplotlib library (which in turn uses the Numpy library), with the aim of extending the functionalities of the existing software .
## Description 📝
An extended Wa‑Tor predator–prey simulation on a continuous toroidal grid.  
**Objectives:**  
- Model interactions between sharks, fish, drifting jellyfish (toxic hazards) and regrowing kelp 🌊  
- Observe emergent population dynamics (oscillations, crashes, recoveries) 📈  
- Provide an interactive interface to tweak ecosystem parameters ⚙️  

**Main Results:**  
- Classic predator–prey cycles enhanced by toxic obstacles and renewable food sources 🌱  
- Insight into how simple rule‑based agents produce rich behaviors 🤖  

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Python 3**  
- **NumPy** (numerical modeling)  
- **Matplotlib** (real‑time visualization)  
- **CustomTkinter / Tkinter** (GUI)  

## Instructions 🚀
1. Go to the **Releases** page, click the latest release, and download the **40 MB** installer for your platform. 📥  
2. Choose your preferred settings in the GUI (some limits apply). ⚙️  
3. Click **Start** and watch the ecosystem come to life! 🌿  
4. Tip: Lower the grid size for a closer look at the environment. 🔍
